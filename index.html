            Born in 1984, Kyle grew up in Charlotte, NC experiencing all that was fun for an early 90s kid. After
            graduating from high
            school, he moved to St. Augustine, Florida to attend Flagler College and pursue academics in Psychology and
            finding
            waves to surf. During his time in St. Augustine and later Orlando, Kyle developed an affinity for Design
            and aesthetic, visiting and supporting the local art community. In 2011, he moved to Boston where he
            continued
            his education in Advertising and worked for a startup focused on Eldercare. By 2016, he settled in NYC and
